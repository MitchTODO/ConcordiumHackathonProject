cause any debt to be carried, renewed and refinanced for its repayment as my 
Executor may deem advisable taking into consideration the best interest of 
the beneficiaries hereunder.

and description and whosesoever situate, which I may own or have the right to 
dispose of at the time of my death, I give, devise, and bequeath in equal shares 
to Smith. Should the preceding person(s) die before me, then I give, devise and 
bequeath the said property to Alice as substitute beneficiary.

I direct that my Executor and beneficiaries abide by any written statement or 
list by me directing the disposition of tangible personal property not specifically 
disposed of by this Last Will and Testament. This directive is mandatory to the 
extent allowed by law.

"Personal Representative" and refers to the person who is to administer my estate 
and carry out the terms of this Last Will and Testament. I hereby name, constitute 
and appoint Bob as my Executor and direct that my Executor shall serve without bond.
